# Terraform Modules
HCL templates to manage resources using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
Copied from macunha1 (big creature) to document and store modules that I'm using

⚠ Warning ⚠
-------
These modules are in beta, with some points to improve.

If you find any bug or issue, let me know, and I'll work to solve it ASAP.

Suggestions (or Pull Requests) are welcome!

## Requirements

Install Terraform and configure it following [instructions on its site](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html)

Then set your cloud provider necessary credentials, create backend state, and let's get work done!

## Available modules

Inside each module directory you should find their README and usage examples. If you don't find, it means that the module is not done yet.
